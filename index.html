{% capture billboard_description %}

A cloud native programming and operating model for composable data microservices 
on a structured platform. With Spring Cloud Data Flow, developers can create, 
orchestrate and refactor data pipelines through single programming model for common 
use cases such as data ingest, real-time analytics, and data import/export.

{% capture main_content %}

Spring Cloud Data Flow is the cloud native redesign of [Spring XD](http://projects.spring.io/spring-xd/) – a project that aimed to simplify development of Big Data applications. The integration and batch modules from Spring XD are refactored into Spring Boot data-microservices that are now autonomous deployment applications – thus enabling them to take 
full advantage of platform capabilities "natively", and they can independently evolve 
in isolation.

Spring Cloud Data Flow defines best practices for distributed stream and 
batch microservice design patterns.

## Features

* Orchestrate applications across a variety of distributed runtime platforms 
including: Cloud Foundry, Apache YARN, Apache Mesos, and Kubernetes
* Separate runtime dependencies backed by ‘spring profiles’
* Consume stream and batch data-microservices as maven dependency 
* Develop using: DSL, Shell, REST-APIs, Admin-UI, and Flo
* Take advantage of metrics, health checks and remote management of data-microservices
* Scale stream and batch pipelines without interrupting data flows

## Quick Start

Step 1 - Clone [Spring Cloud Data Flow](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow) repository

Step 2 - Start
```
redis-server
```

Step 3 - Build Project
```
mvn clean package
```

Step 4 - Launch **‘local’** Server [_spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local/target_] 
```
java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local-***.jar 
```

Step 5 - Launch Shell [_spring-cloud-dataflow-shell/target_]
```
java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-shell-***.jar
```

Step 6 - Create **‘ticktock’** Stream
```
dataflow:>stream create ticktock --definition "time | log" --deploy
```

Step 7 - Launch Admin UI
http://localhost:9393/admin-ui
