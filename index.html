{% capture billboard_description %}

A cloud native programming and operating model for composable data microservices on a structured platform. It allows 
developers to create, orchestrate and refactor data pipelines with a single programming model for common use cases 
like data ingest, real time analytics, and data import/export.

Spring Cloud Data Flow is the cloud native redesign of [Spring XD](http://projects.spring.io/spring-xd/) – a project that 
aimed to simplify Big Data application development. Existing integration and batch modules from Spring XD are refactored 
as Spring Boot _data-microservices_ that are now autonomous deployment units – thus enabling them to take full advantage of 
environment capabilities "natively" and they can independently evolve in isolation.

Spring Cloud Data Flow defines the best practices for distributed stream and batch microservice applications.

## Features

* Orchestrate applications across a variety of distributed runtime platforms including: Cloud Foundry, Lattice, and Apache YARN
* Separate runtime dependencies backed by ‘spring profiles’
* Consume stream and batch microservices as maven dependency and push it to production
* Develop using: DSL, Shell, REST-APIs, Admin-UI, and Flo
* Take advantage of metrics, health checks and remote management functionalities
* Scale stream and batch pipelines without interrupting data flows

## Quick Start

Step 1 - Clone [Spring Cloud Data Flow](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow) repository

Step 2 - Build Project
```
mvn clean package
```

Step 3 - Start
```
redis-server
```

Step 4 - Launch **‘local’** Implementation of Admin: 
```
java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-local/target/spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-local-***.jar 
```

Step 5 - Launch Shell
```
java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-shell/target/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell-***.jar
```

Step 6 - Create **‘ticktock’** Stream using the Shell
```
dataflow:>stream create ticktock --definition "time | log" --deploy
```

Step 7 - Launch Admin UI
http://localhost:9393/admin-ui
