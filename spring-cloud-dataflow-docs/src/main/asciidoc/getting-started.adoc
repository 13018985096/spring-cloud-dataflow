If you're just getting started with Spring Cloud Dataflow, this is the section
for you! Here we answer the basic "`what?`", "`how?`" and "`why?`" questions. You'll
find a gentle introduction to Spring Cloud Dataflow along with installation instructions.
We'll then build our first Spring Cloud Dataflow application, discussing some core principles as
we go.
